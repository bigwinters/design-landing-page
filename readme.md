## landing page for Insider's Guide to a Website Redesign 
follow along as I rebuild my website from start to finish. I will look at all aspects of the process from page layout and structure, user experience, and tools to use to help make the website optimized for performance.


### The code 
+ Adapted from the [Skeleton Grid](http://getskeleton.com/)
+ Built separate from the code on [Learn to Code With Me](http://learntocodewith.me)
+ Includes two pages, the landing page and the thank you page
+ Both pages saved as .php file extensions because they are setup as custom page templates, following WordPress standards
